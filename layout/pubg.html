					<h2>Pubg</h2>
						<p>It's the most-streamed game on Twitch. It's the No. 3 most-played game on Steam. It's sold 6 million copies in just four months, despite -- and this is <img src="pubg.jpg"> crazy -- being a buggy, unfinished Early Access game with a ridiculous name.<br><br>The other unusual thing about PUBG? Its creator, a 41-year-old Irishman named Brendan Greene, who taught himself to mod games. A former graphic designer and DJ, he's the man behind the name PlayerUnknown, and we published a huge interview with him today.<br><br>One of the more curious things about PlayerUnknown is how rarely he plays his own game. <br>He doesn't have a gaming computer at home -- only a laptop he uses for Netflix. In fact, he doesn't consider himself much of a gamer at all. "I've never played Zelda. I've never played these classic games because they don't interest me," Greene told me. <br><br>There's a method to his madness, though. He wants to keep himself from tainting his creation. "A friend of mine who was a producer didn't listen to a lot of music, because he didn't want to be unduly affected by other music he heard... I view gaming the same way," he said.<br><br>Instead, he mostly watches streamers play his game on Twitch, which he calls "the greatest gameplay debugger out there." (I imagine that makes some people at Twitch very happy.)<br><br>You can read our full interview with PlayerUnknown -- including a lot of info about where the game's headed next</p>
