					<h2>Player protests force change on GTA V mod kit</h2>
						<p>Player protests have prompted the publishers of GTA V to halt legal action against a widely used software add-on for the single-player version.<br>Take-Two claimed the Open IV program that let people <img src="gta1.png">change, or mod, the game's basic elements aided cheats.<br>In response, players wrote thousands of negative reviews of the game and more than 77,000 signed a petition calling for Open IV to be left alone.<br>GTA creator Rockstar also put pressure on Take-Two to change its mind.<br>In a message placed on the GTA V chat forums, Rockstar said "discussions" with Take-Two had led to it ending the legal action.<br><br>Technical challenge<br><br>The row blew up last week when the lead developer of Open IV said the mod kit was being withdrawn because it had been threatened with legal action by Take-Two.<br>At the same time, Take-Two took action that led to the closure of three sites that advertised themselves as a way for people to cheat when playing online versions of the game.<br>These extras let people get huge amounts of in-game cash and easily obtain items that otherwise took hours of playing to acquire.<br>Users of Open IV said Take-Two was wrong to regard the mod kit as a cheating tool because it was designed to work with only single-player versions of GTA.<br>In its forum message, Rockstar acknowledged this distinction and said its discussions with Take-Two had meant that the publisher had now "agreed that it generally will not take legal action against third-party projects involving Rockstar's PC games that are single-player, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of third parties".<br>Rockstar said it believed in "reasonable fan creativity" that let fans show their "passion" for its games.<br><a href="mijn hobby's.html">Terug</a></p>
